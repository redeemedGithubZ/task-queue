# task-queue

This project allows users to create tasks and add them to a queue. The tasks can then be shown in a list or pulled out one by one in the order they were put in.

Compiling and running the program can be done in this file: src/app/QueueApp.java

I decided to store the user's choice in the menu as a char so typing letters doesn't crash the program.
